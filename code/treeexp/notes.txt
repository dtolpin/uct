search tree T (with branching factor b and depth d)
set of handles H of size as number of leaves (b^d)
search algorithm: chooses a move until arrives at a leave,
                 returns the handle in the leave
playout algorithm: selects a move until arrives at a leave,
                 returns outcome of the handle in the leave
                 gets selector
                 passes to next level a next-selector(selector, level,
                 n-levels)
regret is computed as
        the mean of the best handle less the mean of the selected handle


playout algorithms to compare:
        UCT: always UCB
        VCT: UVB once, then UCB
        UVT: always UVB
